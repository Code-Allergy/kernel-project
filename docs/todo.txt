data abort after context switch (high speed), guessing from clobbered registers or interrupted instructions. ? - haven't encountered this in a while now that we disable interrupts during irq handle
vfs basic operations, other than open()
ipc to support message passing between processes
memory allocation apis for processes - increase heap size, etc
load dynamic libraries
test context switch performance
other data structures to make things easier
cleaning up dead code and refactoring some others
- pass in addresses from bootloader for l1 and l2 page tables,
  then copy them and nuke the bss section ? for now just put them in high phys memory

- better mmu setup, and using sections and domains. sections for kernel mem mapping and we can setup support for larger page sizes for user space OR sections for heap
